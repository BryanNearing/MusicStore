This is the music store capstone project for SimpliLearn.

The goal of this project was to put all of our info into action to create a fully functioning music store portal.

The functionality of this website is as follows:

1) When you first enter the website at localhost:8080, you are at the homescreen with navbar links at the top for the products, login, home, and register.

2) If you are registered with the site already you may log in, if you are not, then there is a registration page for users to create an account.

3) You may nagivate to the products tab to view all of the store's products
   All products have a detail button which will bring you to a detailed view of the product where you can add it to your cart.
   You may search all of the products by name in the searchbar at the top of the products page.
   
4) You may not checkout your cart until you are logged in and any attempt to checkout your cart without being logged in will send you to the login page.

5) Once logged in, you may go to the tab with your username at the top in the navbar and edit any of the information in your profile at any time.

6) If logged in, you may checkout your cart for ordering, and the website will take you to an order confirmation page to confirm everything in your cart for ordering.

7) Once your cart has been confirmed for ordering, you are taken to a payment information page where you can enter in your payment info for the order and hit the "pay" button.
